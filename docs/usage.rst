Usage
=====

The app can be run using the included command `sputils`.

Help options can be viewed using the `-h` argument.

Arguments are handled using ConfigArgParse, so command line arguments can be passed to the script or included in config stored in `~/.config/sputils/*.conf`. You probably want to put your user and API details in here.
